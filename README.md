* A [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) application written in
ES6 that uses 6to5 to make the code run everywhere.
* Uses [Reflux](https://www.npmjs.org/package/reflux) for data flows.
* Uses [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for manage pages
* Map data comes from the [OpenStreetMap API 0.6](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6)
  and [Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
* Authenticates against [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  with [osm-auth](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-auth)
* Uses [Base](https://www.mapbox.com/base/) for CSS

The code structure is simple: **all JavaScript is in index.js**.

## Development

This project uses [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to compile
the source code in `index.js` into the bundle of JavaScript in `bundle.js`
that your browser interprets. You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
to install the dependencies of this project and develop on it.

* `npm install`: install dependencies
* `npm start`: start the development server that compiles your JavaScript and
  serves the site at http://localhost:3000/
* `npm run build`: build a production-ready `bundle.js` that you can commit
  and use on the public website.
